EXAMPLES

    Both mazes were produced using Wilson's uniform random
    spanning tree algorithm.  They are easy mainly because they
    are small.  Some larger examples may be found in the images
    folder.

    Since the mazes are perfect (i.e. they are spanning trees,)
    the shortest path in both cases is unique.

        The algorithm reminds me of a children's game.  One person

        people.  The couple splits, and finds partners from those
        standing out. Eventually no one is left standing out.

        away from the source. If there are at least three cells,

        source) which are at most two steps from the source.  If v
        is the number of cells and the maze is connected, then all
